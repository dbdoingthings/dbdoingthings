My name is Dennis Basilio, and I'm a cyber security analyst based out in Los Angeles, CA.
## About me
Just a guy who enjoys learning and doing things. My primary interests are in security operations with a focus in DFIR, threat hunting, log analysis, and SIEM architecture. Some of the things I'm currently working on or learning:
* Threat Intelligence
* Detection Engineering
* DevOps

## For fun
